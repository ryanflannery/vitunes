 * Compatibility goo for other OS's.  These files are intended to add
 * support for various FEATURES that other OS's do not support.  Kinda'
 * like what autoconf is supposed to do, but doesn't.
 *
 * These files consist of the following:
 *
 *    compat.h       This file, which contains the main feature-goo, along
 *                   with any OS specific goo.  See below for details.
 *
 *    compat.c       The counterpart to this file, which includes all the
 *                   necessary #includes of compat/ stuff to add various
 *                   features.
 *
 *    compat/        The directory containing all OpenBSD-specific
 *                   features of vitunes that may be needed on other OS's.
